# code-tests-winter-2015
Various code & design challenges for the job hunt in early 2015. Individual tests will be on appropriately named branches.

## aboutLife Code Test
Create a small functioning application that has 2 accordion views on a single page. The accordion should be implemented as a generic reusable component. Add a button to the page that allows the user to add more accordions to the page. For extra points, include tests of your choice.

#### Installation & running
After clone, run ```NPM install``` & ```bower install``` to generate dependencies. You should just be able to run ```NPM start``` from there and load the app on ```localhost:8000```.

#### Methods & Dev Log
So, I had another code test that involved using client-side JS to add on elements to a page, so I chose to just use that as a starter kit. The repo uses [react-foundation-apps]() as a framework, with gulp and webpack for a build system.
